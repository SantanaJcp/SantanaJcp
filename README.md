# **Hey, I'm Jean Carlos\! 👋**

### **🕊️ Disciple of Christ | Software Engineer | Lifelong Learner**

I believe that technology is a gift that allows us to create, solve, and serve. Above all else, I’m a follower of Jesus Christ. My goal is to bring a standard of excellence and integrity to everything I build, remembering that my work is ultimately for His glory.

### **🚀 What I’m up to these days**

I don't just "write code"—I enjoy building systems that bridge the gap between software and the physical world.

* **The .NET World:** I’m currently deep in the **.NET 9/10** ecosystem.  
* **RFID & Hardware:** One of my favorite challenges is working with  **RFID** integrations. There’s something uniquely satisfying about seeing digital logic interact with physical devices in the real world.  
* **The Modern Web:** When I’m on the frontend, I’m usually reaching for **Vue 3** or **React**. I value speed and clean, reactive interfaces that don't get in the user's way.  
* **AI Integration:** I’m experimenting with **RAG** and AI agents—not just for the hype, but for the freedom.

### **🏠 The "After Hours" (My Homelab)**

When the work day ends, the tinkering doesn't. My M4 pro setup is the command center for my personal "sandbox":

* **Network Guard:** I run **Pi-hole** because I value privacy and a cleaner browsing experience.  
* **Media Hub:** Managing a **Plex** server for the family.  
* **The Lab:** My **Raspberry Pi 4** is constantly being wiped and reflashed as I test new reverse tunnels, network configurations, or self-hosted services.

### **🛠️ My Toolbox**

While I'm always learning, these are the tools I know best:

**Back-end:** .NET 9, NodeJS, TypeScript

**Front-end:** VueJS, React

**Data:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB

**Everything Else:** AWS ( Certification coming soon…), Azure (Enthusiast), Pi and Arduino lover.

### **📫 Let's Chat\!**

I’m always happy to connect with fellow developers, brothers and sisters in Christ, or anyone interested in the tech I'm working with.

*"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord..." — Colossians 3:23*
